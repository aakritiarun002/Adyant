### Problem Statement 
While both men and women contract various conditions, some health issues affect women differently and more commonly. Furthermore, many womenâ€™s health conditions go undiagnosed and most drug trials do not include female test subjects. Even so, women bear exclusive health concerns, such as Breast Cancer, PCOD/PCOS, Uterine Fibroids. Depression and anxiety exhibit more frequently among female patients. Sometimes women neglect or feel hesitant visiting 
Gynecologist and this reluctance results in severe health issues.
